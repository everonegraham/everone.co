Happy New Year and welcome to issue #3 of the Dutchie Pot Newsletter. I hope you're all hitting 2023 off to a good start. If not, there is a ton of time left to turn things around.

In this issue, we will be exploring two-factor authentication for a quick second. Let's get into it.

So, what is Two-factor authentication? Two-factor authentication, or 2FA for short, is a security measure that requires users to provide two different "factors" to access their accounts. If you think about how you normally log in to your account, it only requires a single factor, a password. With 2FA, it adds an extra layer of protection to your online accounts, making it a bit more difficult for hackers to gain access to them. If a hacker can guess/figure-out your password, they will still be unable to access your account unless they also have access to your phone or other device used for 2FA.

I have 2FA enabled on all of my online accounts where it's available. I use the [Google Authenticator app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US&pli=1) for storing my security codes. There are multiple options out there that can be used, such as:

- [Twilio Authy](https://authy.com/guides/twilio/)
- [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/mobile-authenticator-app)

Even thought the option is readily available, many individuals do not have it enabled. One of the main reasons why people do not use 2FA is because they find it inconvenient. They may not want to have to enter a security code every time they log in to their accounts. Additionally, they may not want to have to carry an additional device, such as a security key (more on security keys in a future issue). However, the inconvenience of using 2FA is minor compared to the consequences of having your online accounts compromised.

Ultimately, 2FA is an important security measure that everyone should use for their online accounts. The extra layer of protection it provides is worth the effort, even though it may be inconvenient. By using 2FA, you can help protect yourself from the increasing number of online attacks and ensure that your accounts remain secure.

That's it for the first issue of 2023. Thanks for reading, and see you next time for another issue of the Dutchie Pot Newsletter.
