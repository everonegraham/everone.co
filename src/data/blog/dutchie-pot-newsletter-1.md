Hello and welcome to the first issue of the Dutchie Pot Newsletter. Let's get right into it.

It's October, which is known to many as **National Cybersecurity Awareness Month**.

In a world where cyberattacks are becoming more rampant each day, it is important to take the necessary precautions to protect oneself. Cybersecurity awareness month is a time in which people are encouraged to educate themselves about cybersecurity. Mainly on how they can protect themselves from scams, phishing and other forms of cyberattacks. Overall, how to keep your online accounts safer.

Here are some things that you can do to ensure that your accounts are safer.

1. **Use a password manager** – Password managers are great! You will only need to remember one password, your master password. They will store your username, passwords, even notes about your account. I normally store my security questions and answers in there, since the answers are always random ;).

2. **Enable 2-factor authentication** – I can't stress this enough. Always enable this if the online you are using has that option. This will help to block hackers from getting into your account if they can't provide the 2 factor you enabled on your account. Pretty neat.

3. **Beware of the links you click** – We see links every day, and we randomly click as we go. But some of those links can be very harmful. Be sure to double-check the URL and make sure it matches the website they are trying to visit.

4. **Beware of scammers** – Scammers are always looking to make a profit, and they will do anything to achieve that. They will use a variety of scams and techniques to lure unsuspecting victims into revealing their personal information or even hijack your accounts. Remember, if something looks too good to be true, it more than likely is.

**Bonus**: [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) created a free online course called "[How to stay safe online](https://internet-safety.khanacademy.org/)". They interviewed some of Google's top security experts to create it, and it's completely free. So if you are ready to learn how to be safer online, head over there and sign up today.

Thanks for reading, and see you next time for another issue of the Dutchie Pot Newsletter.
